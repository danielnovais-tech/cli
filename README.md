## Key Features

- **Code Understanding & Editing** - Query and edit large codebases beyond traditional context window limits
- **Workflow Automation** - Automate operational tasks like handling pull requests and complex rebases
- **Enhanced Parser** - Adapted parser specifically optimized for BlackboxAI models
- **Vision Model Support** - Automatically detect images in your input and seamlessly switch to vision-capable models for multimodal analysis

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js version 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.

```bash
curl -qL https://www.npmjs.com/install.sh | sh
```


### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blackboxaicode/cli.git
cd cli
npm install
npm install -g .
```


## Quick Start

```bash
# Start Blackbox Code
blackbox

# Example commands
> Explain this codebase structure
> Help me refactor this function
> Generate unit tests for this module
```

### Session Management

Control your token usage with configurable session limits to optimize costs and performance.

#### Configure Session Token Limit

Create or edit `.blackboxcli/settings.json` in your home directory:

```json
{
  "sessionTokenLimit": 32000
}
```

#### Session Commands

- **`/compress`** - Compress conversation history to continue within token limits
- **`/clear`** - Clear all conversation history and start fresh
- **`/stats`** - Check current token usage and limits

> **Note**: Session token limit applies to a single conversation, not cumulative API calls.

### Vision Model Configuration

Blackbox Code includes intelligent vision model auto-switching that detects images in your input and can automatically switch to vision-capable models for multimodal analysis. **This feature is enabled by default** - when you include images in your queries, you'll see a dialog asking how you'd like to handle the vision model switch.

#### Skip the Switch Dialog (Optional)

If you don't want to see the interactive dialog each time, configure the default behavior in your `.blackboxcli/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "experimental": {
    "vlmSwitchMode": "once"
  }
}
```

**Available modes:**

- **`"once"`** - Switch to vision model for this query only, then revert
- **`"session"`** - Switch to vision model for the entire session
- **`"persist"`** - Continue with current model (no switching)
- **Not set** - Show interactive dialog each time (default)


#### Disable Vision Models (Optional)

To completely disable vision model support, add to your `.blackboxcli/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "experimental": {
    "visionModelPreview": false
  }
}
```

> **Tip**: In YOLO mode (`--yolo`), vision switching happens automatically without prompts when images are detected.

### Authorization

API Key Authentication

For programmatic access or advanced use cases, you can authenticate using an API key:

**Getting Your API Key:**

1. Navigate to the [API Keys section](https://app.blackbox.ai/dashboard) of your BLACKBOX dashboard
2. Your API key will be displayed on this page
3. Click the copy icon to copy the key to your clipboard
4. Run `blackbox configure` and you will be able to set the key 


> **Important:** Treat your API key like a password! Do not share it publicly or commit it to version control.


## Usage Examples

### Explore Codebases

```bash
cd your-project/
blackbox

# Architecture analysis
> Describe the main pieces of this system's architecture
> What are the key dependencies and how do they interact?
> Find all API endpoints and their authentication methods
```

### Code Development

```bash
# Refactoring
> Refactor this function to improve readability and performance
> Convert this class to use dependency injection
> Split this large module into smaller, focused components

# Code generation
> Create a REST API endpoint for user management
> Generate unit tests for the authentication module
> Add error handling to all database operations
```

### Automate Workflows

```bash
# Git automation
> Analyze git commits from the last 7 days, grouped by feature
> Create a changelog from recent commits
> Find all TODO comments and create GitHub issues

# File operations
> Convert all images in this directory to PNG format
> Rename all test files to follow the *.test.ts pattern
> Find and remove all console.log statements
```

### Debugging & Analysis

```bash
# Performance analysis
> Identify performance bottlenecks in this React component
> Find all N+1 query problems in the codebase

# Security audit
> Check for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities
> Find all hardcoded credentials or API keys
```

## Popular Tasks

### Understand New Codebases

```text
> What are the core business logic components?
> What security mechanisms are in place?
