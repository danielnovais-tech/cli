# Web Search Tool (`web_search`)

This document describes the `web_search` tool.

## Description

Use `web_search` to perform a web search. The tool automatically selects the appropriate search provider based on your configuration:

- **BLACKBOX AI Provider**: Uses BLACKBOX AI's native web search with the `blackbox-search` model suffix
- **Other Providers**: Uses the Tavily API for web search

The tool returns a concise answer with sources when possible.

### Arguments

`web_search` takes one argument:

- `query` (string, required): The search query.

## How to use `web_search`

### With BLACKBOX AI Provider

When using BLACKBOX AI as your provider (e.g.,`https://api.blackboxai.com/v1`), the tool automatically uses BLACKBOX AI's native web search capability:

The tool uses the model `blackboxai/blackbox-search` to perform web searches and returns results with citations.

### With Other Providers (Tavily)

For other providers, `web_search` calls the Tavily API directly. You must configure the `TAVILY_API_KEY` through one of the following methods:

1. **Settings file**: Add `"tavilyApiKey": "your-key-here"` to your `settings.json`
2. **Environment variable**: Set `TAVILY_API_KEY` in your environment or `.env` file
3. **Command line**: Use `--tavily-api-key your-key-here` when running the CLI

If the key is not configured and you're not using BLACKBOX AI, the tool will be disabled.

Usage:

```text
web_search(query="Your query goes here.")
```
